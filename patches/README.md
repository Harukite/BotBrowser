# üõ†Ô∏è BotBrowser Patch Examples

> üöß These patches are just a tiny glimpse under the hood. BotBrowser‚Äôs full core remains proprietary and battle-tested against real-world antibots.

BotBrowser is 100% our own IP-every line of core C++ comes from scratch, with **no borrowed open-source or closed-source code**. We‚Äôve open-sourced only the GUI [BotBrowserConsole](https://github.com/MiddleSchoolStudent/BotBrowser/tree/main/console) to let you launch and manage sessions safely. All core engine patches shown here are a minimal subset, published solely to illustrate key techniques without exposing our full toolbox.

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

- **Proprietary Foundation**  
  BotBrowser‚Äôs engine is entirely homegrown‚Äîno forks, no references to external projects.

- **Selective Open-Source**  
  We publish only a handful of patches in this folder. The rest stay private to prevent antibots from zeroing in on every leak point.

- **Comprehensive Leak Coverage**  
  Our patches plug gaps at every conceivable fingerprinting surface. Crafted through:
  1. Hands-on reverse engineering of antibot defenses  
  2. V8-level analysis of how antibots collect and validate fingerprints  
  3. Real-world automation experience at scale

- **Get the Full Engine**
