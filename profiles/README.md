# BotBrowser Profiles

> üì¢ In BotBrowser, everything starts with a profile. Your stealth, reliability, and success depend on it.

Profiles in BotBrowser are encrypted files that define the complete environment a browser instance should emulate.  
They not only include detailed **browser fingerprint** information (like user agent, WebGL, screen size, and more), but also extend to **system-level settings** such as proxy configuration, timezone, language preferences, window size, screen properties, device memory, CPU architecture, and even platform-specific features like Android behavior simulation.  

By using a profile, BotBrowser can launch sessions that mimic real human devices and browsing patterns across different operating systems and devices, achieving maximum stealth against even the most sophisticated antifraud and antibot detection systems.

üëâ **In short: A profile = a complete, customizable virtual browser identity.**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice About Profiles

#### üö® Demo Profile Warning
> **Note**: Public demo profiles are for limited-time testing only. To prevent abuse they can't be used in headless mode, and can't load extensions.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Using them in production environments **will result in immediate account bans**, as they‚Äôre widely circulated and easily flagged.  
>  üîí Protect your operations by using **Premium Profiles**, authentic profiles with proper access controls.  

#### üåü Premium Profile Service
> Access our exclusive pool of **300,000+ authentic browser fingerprints** sourced from real users (not algorithm-generated). Each profile is:
> - ‚úÖ Unique and never reused
> - üîí Private and secure
> - üë§ Based on genuine device/browser data
> - üõ°Ô∏è Safe for production and scalable automation

### üìö How to Use Profiles

#### 1. CLI

Launch BotBrowser with a profile:

```bash
chromium --bot-profile="/absolute/path/to/chrome135_win11_x64.enc"
```

 >  **Note:**
 >  - Ensure the BotBrowser binary major version matches the profile‚Äôs version.  
 >    For example, BotBrowser v138 only supports profiles created for version 138 and cannot load profiles from version 137 or 139.
 >  - If a profile fails to load using a relative path, specify the full absolute path with the `--bot-profile` flag to guarantee correct loading.


#### 2. [Playwright](demo/playwright) / [Puppeteer](demo/puppeteer) Demos

```javascript
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  headless: true,
  executablePath: BOTBROWSER_EXEC_PATH, // Absolute path to the BotBrowser executable
  args: [`--bot-profile=${BOT_PROFILE_PATH}`], // Absolute path to the bot profile
});

const page = await browser.newPage();

// Remove Playwright's bindings to avoid detection.
await page.addInitScript(() => {
  delete window.__playwright__binding__;
  delete window.__pwInitScripts;
});
await page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/");
```

### üìñ Important: Customize Your Profile Configurations

Starting from 2025, BotBrowser now supports **full environment customization directly inside profiles** ‚Äî including proxy, timezone, screen size, device pixel ratio, and more.

üëâ **Please read** [`profile-configs.md`](https://github.com/MiddleSchoolStudent/BotBrowser/blob/main/profiles/profile-configs.md) **for full configuration options.**

You no longer need CDP to set these fields manually!
