## [2025-05-13]

### Added
- **Auto Timezone via IP Lookup**  
  - Introduced built-in IP geolocation detection based on proxy exit IP, allowing automatic adjustment of timezone and location.  
  - Controlled via the `configs.autoTimezone` flag (enabled by default). See [profile-configs.md](https://github.com/MiddleSchoolStudent/BotBrowser/blob/main/profiles/profile-configs.md) for details.

- **Theme Control via `configs.colorScheme`**  
  - Users can now specify browser color scheme (`dark` or `light`) through profile configuration. If omitted, the profile's native scheme is used.

### Improved
- **Bot-Profile Validation**  
  - Improved error handling when launching with a missing or invalid `--bot-profile` path. The browser will now exit with a clear message.

- **Relative Path Support**  
  - `--bot-profile` now supports relative paths in addition to absolute paths, simplifying multi-environment usage.

- **Default Font Simulation**  
  - Embedded Windows, macOS, and Android system font libraries.  
  - Allows simulating native font environments across platforms (e.g. load macOS fonts on Ubuntu), preventing rendering mismatches and fingerprint leaks.

- **matchMedia Hardened in WebPreferences**  
  - Improved injection of matchMedia parameters directly into WebPreferences for greater reliability and fingerprint consistency.  
  - Fixes occasional race conditions where matchMedia simulation failed to load.

- **System UI Font Emulation**  
  - Enhanced simulation of OS-specific UI fonts like `kSmallCaption`, `kMenu`, and `kStatusBar` across Windows, macOS, and Linux for stronger OS fingerprint fidelity.

### Fixed
